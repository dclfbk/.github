Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Bruno Kessler Foundation's [Digital Commons Lab](https://dcl.fbk.eu)

In this space you will find some of our projects and much of the internship and thesis work we do with students who want to get involved with us

Some of the projects may appear haphazard, but each of them is the result of great ideas that later became successful theses and proofs of concept.

The advice is to browse and perhaps collaborate
Anyone who wants to participate is welcome
